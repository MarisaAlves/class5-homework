# Running data-processor.py

To run the data-processor.py file the following libraries must be installed: pandas, matplotlib, os, and seaborn
To install the following, may use pip and run the command in the terminal as follows:
```bash
pip3 install pandas
```

For running the file, must also ensure to have the diabetes.data file within the same python project file, or change the file's location within the code.

The plots will be auto-saved to a folder termed plots within the python project's folder.

# Additional type of plot

For the additional plot to visualize 2 or more features of the diabetes dataset I chose to do a correlogram.
The correlogram creates a chart with individual boxes containing the correlation coefficient between the variable on the horizontal axis, with the variable on the vertical axis.
This plot contains values between -1 (absolutely negatively correlated) and 1 (asolutely positively correlated) as well as being color-coordinated with the legend of colours along the right side of the chart.
